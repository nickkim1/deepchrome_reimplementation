# deepchrome_reimplementation
Reimplementation of deepchrome model from the following paper: https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/32/17/i639/2450757



The following scripts were created: 
1. doall.py: runs everything from training to evaluation, generates AUC and loss scores, and saves into a specified directory. 
2. featmap.py: generates combinatorial interaction heatmaps based on an input-optimized base model. 
3. optim.py:
